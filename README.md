## Projects

### 1. Kaggle Deep Learning Course
- Used TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

### 2. BCG X Gen AI Forage Simulation Work
- [Data Analysis File](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/BCG%20X.ipynb)
- [Chatbot Code File](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/app.py)
- Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for BCG's GenAI Consulting team.
- Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.
- Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports, employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.

### 3. British Airways Data Analysis Forage Simulation Work
- [Web Scraping and Analysis File](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/Forage%20British%20Airways.ipynb)
- [Predicting Customer Bookings - Random Forest File](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/British%20Airways%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)
- Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways' success.
- Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings.
- Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour.

### 4. MSU Data Science Project: Predicting and Optimizing the Usage of Bike Sharing Systems
- [Project File](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/CMSE%20201%20Project.ipynb)
- Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to execute an extremely in depth analysis on bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshare.
- Applied curve fitting  to data (using a modified sine function), applied descriptive statistics to data, and thoroughly visualized variable relationships to uncover important insights. These insights provided information on how bikeshar companise like this one can optimize their future endeavors.

### 5. MSU Data Science Project: What is the Magnitude of Magnitude?
- [Project Code](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/STT%20180%20Honors%20Project.Rmd)
- [Project Write Up](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/STT180%20Honors%20Option%20(1).pdf)
- Used R and various packages such as dplyr, tidyverse, infer, broom, and ggplot to explore the relationships between magnitude and other variables present in an earthquake dataset
- Thoroughly visualized variable relationships to uncover data insights, used linear regression to create a model that can predict magnitude based on other variables (depth, location, etc.), used inference testing to draw concrete conclusions about variable relationships
