## Projects

### 1. Kaggle Deep Learning Course
- Used TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

### 2. [BCG X Gen AI Forage Simulation Work](forage-bcg-x-genai/README.md)
- Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for BCG's GenAI Consulting team.
- Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.
- Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports, employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.

### 3. [British Airways Data Analysis Forage Simulation Work](forage-british-airways/README.md)
- Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways' success.
- Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings.
- Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour.

### 4. [MSU Data Science Project: Predicting and Optimizing the Usage of Bike Sharing Systems](https://github.com/connorcurtis6/ConnorCurtis-Portfolio/blob/main/CMSE%20201%20Project.ipynb)
- Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to execute an extremely in depth analysis on bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshare.
- Applied curve fitting  to data (using a modified sine function), applied descriptive statistics to data, and thoroughly visualized variable relationships to uncover important insights. These insights provided information on how bikeshar companise like this one can optimize their future endeavors.
